# Static Variables (and Globals)

The keyword `static` denotes a persistant name that is not visible outside its current scope.

A `static` global is not visible outside the file it is defined in.

A `static` local variable is persistant across function calls and is not known outside the function.

A `static` method is a little different: it is known within a `class` or `struct` but is not associated with a specific instance of the `class` or `struct`.

This section discusses how `static` variables are defined in assembly language.
