# Review and Amplification of the `ldr` Instructions

## Overview

In this section we will review the `ldr` family of instructions. By extension, this section covers `ldp` and the `str` instructions indirectly.

Several example programs will be presented.

## Loading Data From RAM into Registers

The instructions most commonly used to retrieve information from memory are `ldr` and `ldp`. The characters `ld` in these mnemonics bring to mind `load`. `ldr` is "load a register" while `ldp` is "load a pair of registers".

Both of these instructions possess many variations, only a few of which will be described here. In common to all variations of the `ldr` and `ldp` instructions are the notions of *where to fetch from* and *where to store what's been fetched*.

Like many AARCH64 instructions, the most basic form of the load instructions are read right to left as in:

```asm
    ldr    x0, [x1]
```

which means "go to the location in RAM specified by `x1` and load what's there into `x0`."

Similarly,

```asm
    ldp    x0, x1, [sp]
```

loads a *pair* of registers from RAM at the address specified by the stack pointer.

## Offsets

To facilitate dereferencing `structs` and for accessing `arrays`, an offset may be specified.

There are significant restrictions placed on offsets because (among other reasons) the entire instruction (including the encoding of the offset) must fit within a constant 4 byte width of all AARCH64 instructions.

Here is text from an [ARM manual](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/dui0801/h/A64-Data-Transfer-Instructions/LDR--immediate-):

```text
1) LDR Xt, [Xn|SP{, #pimm}] ; 64-bit general registers
2) LDR Xt, [Xn|SP], #simm ; 64-bit general registers, Post-index
3) LDR Xt, [Xn|SP, #simm]! ; 64-bit general registers, Pre-index
```

These say you can load an `x` register (for simplicity we have ignored `w` registers) by dereferencing another `x` register or the stack pointer (i.e. `[Xn|SP]`).

Line 1 says you can *optionally* specify an offset.

Lines 2 and 3 says you can specify a *change* to the dereferenced register either before the actual fetch or after.

Assume `ptr` is a pointer to a `long`.

Line 2 corresponds to: `*(ptr++)`. Line 3 corresponds to: `*(++ptr)`.

Concerning the restrictions placed on the offsets:

* `simm` can be in the range of -256 to 255 (10 bite signed value).
* `pimm` can be in the range of 0 to 32760 in multiples of 8.

`w` registers are used for `int`, `short` and `char`. When working with `int`, `simm` must be a multiple of 4. When working with `short`, `simm` must be even.

## Examples

### Array Indexing 1 - Wasteful

Consider this code to sum up the values in an array:

```c
long Sum(long * values, long length)                                    /* 1 */
{                                                                       /* 2 */
    long sum = 0;                                                       /* 3 */
    for (long i = 0; i < length; i++)                                   /* 4 */
    {                                                                   /* 5 */
        sum += values[i];                                               /* 6 */
    }                                                                   /* 7 */
    return sum;                                                         /* 8 */
}                                                                       /* 9 */
```

We're not going to translate this to assembly language. Instead, we will call out how inefficient this code is. Notice we're using the index variable `i` for nothing more than traipsing through the array. This is fantastically inefficient (in this case).

### Array Indexing 2 - More Efficiently

Consider the following code that performs the same function:

```c
long Sum(long * values, long length)                                    /* 1 */
{                                                                       /* 2 */
    long sum = 0;                                                       /* 3 */
    long * end = values + length;                                       /* 4 */
    while (values < end)                                                /* 5 */
    {                                                                   /* 6 */
        sum += *(values++);                                             /* 7 */
    }                                                                   /* 8 */
    return sum;                                                         /* 9 */
}                                                                       /* 10 */
```

Notice we don't use an index variable any longer. Instead, we use the pointer itself for both the dereferencing *and* to tell us when to stop the loop.

`values` begins as the address of the first `long` in the array. On `line 4` we leverage *address arithmetic* to determine where to stop. `end` gets the address of the `long` just beyond the end of the array. When we get there, we stop.

This approach, which avoids the overhead of a loop variable, works well in both `C` and `C++`. It is similar in spirit to this in `C++`:

```c++
    vector<Foo> foov;
    for (auto it = foov.begin(); it < foov.end(); it++)
```

Here is a hand translation of the above `C` code:

```asm
    .global Sum                                                         // 1 
    .text                                                               // 2 
    .align  2                                                           // 3 
                                                                        // 4 
//  x0 is the pointer to data                                           // 5 
//  x1 is the length and is reused as `end`                             // 6 
//  x2 is the sum                                                       // 7 
//  x3 is the current dereferenced value                                // 8 
                                                                        // 9 
Sum:                                                                    // 10 
    mov     x2, xzr                                                     // 11 
    add     x1, x0, x1, lsl 3                                           // 12 
    b       2f                                                          // 13 
                                                                        // 14 
1:  ldr     x3, [x0], 8                                                 // 15 
    add     x2, x2, x3                                                  // 16 
2:  cmp     x0, x1                                                      // 17 
    blt     1b                                                          // 18 
                                                                        // 19 
    mov     x0, x2                                                      // 20 
    ret                                                                 // 21 
                                                                        // 22 
    .end                                                                // 23 
```

Recall that `Sum(long * values, long length)` means that `x0` has the address of the first long in the array.

* We know it's an `x` register because it is an address.
* We know it is the `0` register because it is the first argument.

`x1` contains `length`.

* We know it is an `x` register because it is a `long`.
* We know it is the `1` register because it is the second argument.

`Line 12` is the first really interesting line. It implements `line 4` of the higher level language. That is:

```c
    long * end = values + length;
```

is implemented as:

```asm
    add     x1, x0, x1, lsl 3 
```

We are performing address arithmetic on `longs`. Each `long` is 8 bytes wide. `x1, lsl 3` means "before adding the value of `x1` to `x0`, multiple `x1` by 8." Eight is 2 raised to the power of 3. `lsl 3` means shift left by 3 bits ... shifting is a fast way of integer multiplication (and division) by powers of 2.

`Line 13` is the branch to the *bottom* of the loop where the decision code is written. We saw how this can save an instruction [here](../../for/for.md).

`Line 15` is the `ldr` instruction which performs not only the load (dereference) but also the *post increment* of the pointer.

```c
    sum += *(values++);                                                 /* 7 */
```

is implemented by both `lines 15` and `16` in the assembly language.

```asm
1:  ldr     x3, [x0], 8                                                 // 15 
    add     x2, x2, x3                                                  // 16 
```

### Fast Memory Copy

This is a heavily contrived example. In reality it is a fun challenge to write an optimal general purpose `memcpy` function. Or, you can use `memcpy`.

For the purposes of this discussion, ignore issues relating to alignment.

Suppose you needed to copy 16 bytes of memory from one place to another. You might do it like this:

```c++
void SillyMove16(uint8_t * dest, uint8_t * src)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < 16; i++)
        *(dest++) = *(src++);
}
```

This is especially silly as why would you go through 16 loops when you could have simply:

```c++
void SillyMove16(uint64_t * dest, uint64_t * src)
{
    *(dest++) = *(src++); // 3
    *dest = *src;         // 4
}
```

`Line 3` dereferences `src`, holds the value that's there and increments `src` by the size of a `long`. The assignment puts the value dereferenced from `src` into the location specified by `dest` and increments the pointer afterwards.

`Line 4` is simplified because this silly move is only two `longs` long.

In assembly language, this could be written:

```asm
SillyMove16:
    ldr    x2, [x0], 8    // 2
    str    x2, [x1], 8    // 3
    ldr    x2, [x0]       // 4
    str    x2, [x1]       // 5
    ret
```

`Lines 2` and `3` increment `x0` and `x1` to the next `long` after dereferencing them.

Then again, what about the *pair* load and store instructions?

```asm
SillyMove16:
    ldp    x2, x3, [x0]
    stp    x2, x3, [x1]
    ret
```

As an interesting aside, remember the `q` registers? They are 16 bytes wide by themselves.

```asm
SillyMove16:
    ldr    q2, [x0]
    str    q2, [x1]
    ret
```

### Indexing Through An Array of `struct`

Here is a more realistic case study. Given this:

```c
#include <stdio.h>                                                      /* 1 */
                                                                        /* 2 */
struct Person                                                           /* 3 */
{                                                                       /* 4 */
    char * fname;                                                       /* 5 */
    char * lname;                                                       /* 6 */
    int age;                                                            /* 7 */
};                                                                      /* 8 */
                                                                        /* 9 */
extern int rand();                                                      /* 10 */
extern struct Person * FindOldestPerson(struct Person *, int);          /* 11 */
                                                                        /* 12 */
struct Person * OriginalFindOldestPerson(struct Person * people, int length) /* 13 */
{                                                                       /* 14 */
    int oldest_age = 0;                                                 /* 15 */
    struct Person * oldest_ptr = NULL;                                  /* 16 */
                                                                        /* 17 */
    if (people)                                                         /* 18 */
    {                                                                   /* 19 */
        struct Person * end_ptr = people + length;                      /* 20 */
        while (people < end_ptr)                                        /* 21 */
        {                                                               /* 22 */
            if (people->age > oldest_age)                               /* 23 */

    struct Person * oldest = FindOldestPerson(array, LENGTH);           /* 43 */
    for (int i = 0; i < LENGTH; i++)                                    /* 44 */
    {                                                                   /* 45 */
        printf("%d", array[i].age);                                     /* 46 */
        if (oldest == &array[i])                                        /* 47 */
            printf("*");                                                /* 48 */
        printf("\n");                                                   /* 49 */
    }                                                                   /* 50 */

```

`FindOldestPerson()` will march through the array of `struct Person` to find the oldest individual returning a pointer to that `struct`. In case of a tie, the first person found will be returned. The array is checked against `NULL` and if found to be so, `NULL` is returned.

`gcc` with `-O2` or `-O3` optimization rendered `OriginalFindOldestPerson()` into 18 lines of assembly language.

This example is more "real world" in that it offers us the chance to work with `w` registers (`int`). It also demonstrates `csel` which is like the `C` and `C++` `ternary operator`.

Before we get to the explanation, permit us a small pat on the back. The above version, written by us humans, rendered `FindOldestPerson()` in 15 lines. To be fair, the length of the tightest loop was the same at 7 lines.

`Lines 5` through `11` are vitally important comments. You should always write comments like these as they will serve as your "dictionary" to help you keep track of what particular registers will be used for.

`x0` begins as the pointer to `struct Person` being passed to us. `x0` is also used for returning values from a function so we'll copy `x0` to `x3` on `line 16`. This will save us an instruction later as we won't have to copy the intended return value back to `x0` prior to the `ret` on `line 30`.

`w1` is passed to us as the length of the array. It is in a `w` register because we defined it as an `int`.

`w2` will hold the oldest age found so far. It is a `w` register because we defined age as an `int`.

`x3` is described above under `x0`.

`x4` will be set to the address after the end of the array and will be used to stop our loop.

`w5` is used for scratch.

Recall that registers 0 through 7 are scratch registers and do not have to be backed up or restored.

`Line 14` is a combination compare AND branch instruction.

```asm
       cbz     x0, 99f
```

says "Check `x0`. If it is zero, branch forward to temporary lable 99." The `cbz` mnemonic means "compare and branch if zero." There is also a `cbnz` instruction branching if not zero.

The `cbz` and `cbnz` instructions exist because testing against zero is so common.

This instruction is the same as:

```asm
        cmp    x0, xzr
        beq    99f
```

We did not choose the value 99 at random. This line was written at a time when we did not yet know what other temporary labels we might be needing. 99 is a large number that we would be unlikely to run into with other temporary labels. You might establish the habit of using a value like 99 to be your favorite value for the last label in a function.

`Line 14` implements `line 18` of the `C` code. 

The closing brace found on `line 30` of the `C` code is implemented on `line 30` of the assembly language code. A coincidence, surely.

`Line 15` establishes the oldest age found so far as being 0.

`Line 16` copies the base address of the array to `x3` from `x0`. The value arrives in `x0` because it is the first parameter to the function. It must be an `x` register because it is a pointer. We need a pointer to march through the array. `x0` serves double duty as holding the first parameter but also as the place where function return values are found. 

We copy `x0` out to `x3` so that we can use `x0` to store a pointer to the array element representing the oldest person found so far. If we iterated over the array using `x0`, we would still a) need another `x` register to hold the pointer to the oldest person so far and b) have to copy this register to `x0` before we return anyway. Doing the marching through the array is a register *other* than `x0` saves us one instruction.

`Line 17` initializes `x0` after we've preserved its original value in `x3`.

`Line 18` puts the value of 24 into `w5`. This register is used for scratch or intermediate calculation purposes. We're setting up the calculation which ends with the pointer to just beyond the end of the array. The size of the `struct Person` is 24 bytes (not 20). We considered allowing the assembler to compute this for us but chose instead of hard code the value.

`Line 19` is a mouthful. The mnemonic `smaddl` means *signed multiply add long*. Here is the instruction:

```asm
        smaddl  x4, w1, w5, x3      // initialize end_ptr               // 19 
```

`w1` (the length) will be multipled by `w5` (the size of each array member), added to `x3` (the base address of the array) and the result will be placed into `x4`. This assembly language instruction implements this:

```c
        struct Person * end_ptr = people + length;                      /* 20 */
```

`Line 20` branches to the `while` loop's decision test. Putting the decision test of a loop at the loop's bottom rather than the top has previously been shown to save one instruction.

`Line 22` begins the main loop of this function. `w5` is loaded with the `int` found 16 bytes away from the address pointed to by `x3`. In this case, we allowed the assembler to compute the 16 for us - you can see this on `lines 33` through `37`. A `w` register is used because `age` is an `int`.

`Line 23` compares the current age to the largest age found so far. This is a key line in that the `cmp` sets *status bits* which are used by the next two, very cool, instructions.

`Line 24` and `25` both make use of the `csel` instruction. The mnemonic means "conditional select". The comparison **has already been made** (on `line 23`) setting the CPU's status bits recording if the comparison resulted in a less than zero, zero, or more than zero result.

`Lines 24` and `25` read:

```asm
        csel    w2, w2, w5, gt      // update based on cmp              // 24 
        csel    x0, x0, x3, gt      // update based on cmp              // 25 
```

These are identical to this:

```c
        w2 = (w5 > w2) ? w5 : w2;
        x0 = (x5 > x2) ? x3 : x0;
```

**Remember that the condition or status bits have already been set based upon whether or not the current age is greater than (or equal to) the oldest age found so far. Both of the `csel` instructions leverage the outcome of the comparison, done just once.**

`csel`, like the `C` and `C++` ternary operator, is quite cool in that we get the results of an `if` statement without the overhead of branching instructions!

`Line 26` increments the loop pointer to the next array member or to the end of the array.

`Line 27` compares the new value of the loop pointer to the address coming after the array.

`Line 28` will branch to the next iteration of the loop if `x3` has not yet advanced as far as `x4` sitting past the end of the array.

`Line 30` is simply a `ret` without no other bookkeeping because the value we want to return has been sitting in `x0` all along! A reminder that we did not need to preserve the value of `x30`, for example, because this function makes no function calls. `x30`, our return address, remains safely unchanged.
