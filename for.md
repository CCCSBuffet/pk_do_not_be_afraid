## Overview

We have already covered the [`if`](./if.md) and [`while`](./while.md) statements. We demonstrate that a `while` loop is nothing more than an `if` statement with one additional label preceding and one unconditional branch following the code for an `if` statement.

A `for` loop is only slightly more complex.

## In `C`

In `C`, a for loop looks like this:

## How You Picture It Versus How It is Implemented

The image on the left, below, represents from top to bottom what the parts of the `for` are from left to right (the post step being found at the bottom).

The image on the right, above, depicts how `for` loops are typically implemented. The reason for this becomes clear when we see the assembly language.

## In Assembly Language

This code:

![for in c](./for02c.png)

could be implemented like this in assembly language:

![for in s](./for03s.png)

This corresponds to the flow chart on the left, above. There are 4 instructions in the loop (ignoring the code block).

The next set of assembly language corresponds to the flow chart on the right, above, where the post step and decision comes *after* the code block.

![for in s](./for04s.png)

Notice this contains one fewer lines of assembly language within the loop itself (3 lines versus 4).

## Implementing a `continue`

Now let's add a `continue` to the code block, dividing it in two. 

Here is what we would need to write to support a `continue` if the "conventional" ordering were used with the decision evaluation at the top:

![for s](./for06s.png)

Below, is how a `for` loop is **typically** implemented.

![for s](./for05s.png)

Once again, the code moving the post step and decision evaluation to the bottom is one fewer instruction inside the loop.

## Summary

`for` loops typically contain code ordering different from what one might expect. This is done to save an instruction. While this doesn't sound like much, consider the case where the loop is executed billions of times. In this case, saving one instruction per loop prevents the execution of a billion instructions.
The shorter the code block is, the more important it is to save one instruction from within the loop.
