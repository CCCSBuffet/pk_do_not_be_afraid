## Overview

This document is a gentle introduction to ARM V8 Assembly Language.
What makes this a "gentle" introduction is that we start out with a C++
program close to "Hello World" and break it down into several versions
which are closer and closer to a high level assembly language (otherwise
known as C). Finally, we convert the C into ARM V8 assembly language.

At each step, we'll completely explain the code and document what has
changed from version to version so that little background is assumed.

Note that the assembly language conventions followed in this introduction
conforms to Linux. MacOS uses a different convention so if you're on a Mac
will need to use a VM. Similarly, on Windows you will need to use WSL (the
Windows Subsystem for Linux). We apologize for this complication but take
this step so that the same assembly language will work on the three major
platforms (which is a bit of a stretch because all three platforms devolve
to Linux).

## V1 in C++

Here is the code to a program which prints to the console the contents
of `argv`, that is: the command line arguments specified when the
program is run from the shell.

Here is the output of this program:

![./output.png](./output.png)

## Line 1

`Line 1` makes available the default output stream `cout`. `cout` stands for `c`onsole `out`put. The angle brackets (`<` and `>`) indicate the include file `iostream` comes from a language supplied directory as opposed to an
include file written by you.

For an explanation of what an `include` file is and how it fits into the compilation workflow [see here](https://youtu.be/Iv3psS4n9j8).

## Line 3

`Line 3` is a common statement in C++ programs. It allows the use of many standard library features such as `cout` by typing fewer characters. In this case, for example, `line 7` without the `line 3` `using` would read:

```c++
std::cout << *(argv++) << std::endl;
```

## Line 5

`Line 5` is a function declaration declaring `main`. In command line
programs (and indeed in many non-command line programs), a function
called `main` is necessary. In all respects save one, `main` is an
ordinary user-written function. What makes `main` special is its name
and its paramters (typically called `argc` and `argv`). A function named
`main` is special because by default it is the function at which your
code will begin execution.

`argc` is an integer argument which specifies the number of *non-null*
arguments found by following the *pointers* contained in in `argv`. We will
explain *non-null* and *pointers* later.

In the case of the execution portrayed above, `argv` would have the value
of `4`. `argc` **always** has a value of at least 1. This is because the
first command line argument accessible via `argv` is the *path* to the
program being executed. For our purposes, think of the *path* as like the *name* of the program.

`argv` is declared as a *pointer to zero or more pointers to chars*. The
concept of a *pointer* is essential to understanding assembly language.
*Pointers* are also scary for new programmers. They don't have to be. When
you see the word *pointer* used, think *address of* something.

*"pointer to a pointer"* sounds scary too but if you think of pointers as *address of*, then *"pointer to a pointer"* means something which contains the address of something else which itself hold the address of a third thing.

In this case, the first *something* is `argv`. It contains the address of
an array holding 1 or more addresses of strings.

Here is a picture depicting this:

![argv](./argv.png)

### Explanation of "non-null"

The above diagram also illustrates what we meant by *non-null*. *argc* contains the value of 4 in this case. Looking at the array pointed to by
`argv` you will notice **5** boxes (or *elements*) arranged in a succession
of memory locations. This type of arrangement is called an *array*.

Notice that the very last element in the array contains a `NULL` in C or
`nullptr` in C++. It is not counted by `argc` because it is, in fact, null.
By the way, null is associated with the value of `0`. We will use this
fact (that the last value in the array is `0` to our advantage).

## Line 5 Continued

One final comment about `line 5` is that it currently reads

```c++
char * argv[]
```

accentuating that array property of `argv` but it could equivallently
have been written:

```c++
char ** argv
```

accentuating the *pointer to a pointer* (i.e. two successive `*`) quality of `argv`. Here the `*` indicates *pointer*. Two in a row means *pointer to a pointer*.

## Line 6

```c++
while (*argv) {
```

introduces a `while` loop. The code (i.e. the *body* of the loop) will
repeatedlly execute as long as the value inside the parenthesis is found
to be `true` (i.e. non-zero or specifically in our case *non-null*).
The evaluation of `*argv` in the while loop means the loop will repeat
as long as `argv` is the address of a memory location that does not contain
*null*.

Somewhere inside the body of the loop, the value of `argv` will be changed.
If it were not, the loop would not terminate (i.e. an *infinite loop*).

### Line 6 could be redone as a `for` loop

`Line 6` in this case could have been written using a `for` loop:

```c++
for (int index = 0; index < argc; index++)
```

Using this approach will result in more assembly language code being
generated along with the introduction of an otherwise unneeded variable
`index`. `index` will range from `0` to `3` (stopping when index ceases
to be less than `4`). `index` would be used in figuring out which
member of `argv` is examined in each loop. We claim `index` is unneeded in
this case as we have a different way of moving through the `argv` array.

## Line 7

`Line 7` is where is action is. Firstly, `cout` will receive some value for printing. `cout` is an output stream and the `<<` indicates something is being
shoved into it - i.e. is being output.

At the end of `line 7` is `endl`. This is a C++ shorthand for printing a
new line. In total `line 7` prints something followed by advancing the
output to a new line.

### What will be printed?

`*(argv++)` is complicated. Let's break it down.

We examine what is inside the parentheses first (as demanded by the rules
governing the *order of operations).

The value of `argv` is captured first. Recall this value is the address
of an address of some characters This value is put aside for a moment but
will be used soon.

Next the value of `argv` is incremented (the `++`). We know the value of
`argv` is captured first because the `++` comes *after* `argv`. This is
how `argv` changes so as to step through the elements of the array. At
some point `argv` will contain the address of a `0` - and thar's what
will terminate the `while` loop.

After `argv` is incremented, its **previous** value is *dereferenced* indicated
by the `*` outside the parentheses. Remember, we put the value aside before 
incrementing it. 

`argv` contains the address of something.
Dereferencing `argv` means "go fetch what is found at the address specified
by `argv`". That, dear reader, will be the address of the string of characters to be printed.

## Line 8

`Line 8` contains a matching brace for the opening brace found line `line 6`.
This marks the end of the `while` loop's *body*. The `}` causes a **jump**
back to evaluating what is pointed to by argv to see if it is now null (which
exits the loop). A synonym for **jump** is **branch** - remember this.

## Line 9

This program is itself invoked by another program (in this case the shell).
The value returned by `main` is received by the program which launched this program. `Line 9` causes the shell to be able to receive the value 0 which,
by convention, means our pro0gram exited normally.
